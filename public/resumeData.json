    "bio":"My name is Mary Kang. I recently took an exciting pivot in my career and I am looking for my first Web Developer job. My professional background in Supply Chain and Information Systems serves as the foundation for my business acumen, project management skills, and cross-functional collaboration strengths. When I'm not sitting in front of a computer, I love being outdoors - usually to hike, camp, take photographs, or play disc golf! I am a dedicated yogi, and my practice has equipped me to embody the mindset of a life-long learner - both in yoga and in coding.",
